# Git: clone, status, add, commit, push, pull
Git is the most popular version control system and weâ€™ll use GitHub to release assignments and to receive your submissions.  
  
It is essential that you understand:  
  
How to clone a repository: git clone git@github.com:Vikram2Agrawal/Loneless  
The difference between the history (graph of previous commits), the index (draft of next commit), the working directory (files currently in the directory).
How to check which files have changed (git status)
How to add file changes to the index (git add .)
How to commit changes that you added to the index (git commit -m "Add assignment files")
How to push local commits (git push) and pull remote ones (git pull)
